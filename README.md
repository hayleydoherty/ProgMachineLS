# ProgMachineLS
Project for the Machine Learning and Statistics module

The aim of this project is to create a web service that makes predictions of wind turbine power based on wind speed values.

The jupyter notebook contains the method used to generate the model and an explanation of what the code does.

The power.py script contains the Flask app that connects a server and hosts a html page through which wind speed values can be input. 

The Power_prediction html page contains a form made up of input box and button into which the wind speed value can be entered.
